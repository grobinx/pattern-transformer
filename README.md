# Pattern Transformer

Pattern Transformer is a Node.js tool built with TypeScript that allows you to transform strings based on a predefined map of regular expressions. It is designed to simplify and automate string transformations by applying custom patterns and rules.

## Project Structure

```
pattern-transformer
├── src
│   ├── index.ts          # Entry point of the application
│   └── utils
│       └── helper.ts     # Utility functions
├── package.json          # npm configuration file
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration file
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pattern-transformer
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The main functionality of the tool is provided by a transformation function that takes a string and applies a series of transformations based on a map of regular expressions. You can customize the transformation rules by modifying the map in the source code.

### Example

Here’s an example of how the transformation function works:

```typescript
import { transform } from './src/utils/helper';

const input = "Hello, World!";
const transformationMap = [
  { pattern: /Hello/, replacement: "Hi" },
  { pattern: /World/, replacement: "Universe" }
];

const result = transform(input, transformationMap);
console.log(result); // Output: "Hi, Universe!"
```
